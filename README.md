# CMSC320 - Introduction to Data Science - Fall 2023
## Course Overview
Data science encapsulates the interdisciplinary activities required to create data-centric products and applications that address specific scientific, socio-political, or business questions. It has drawn tremendous attention from both academia and industry and is making deep inroads in industry, government, health, and journalism.

This course focuses on (i) data management systems, (i) exploratory and statistical data analysis, (ii) data and information visualization, and (iv) the presentation and communication of analysis results. It will be centered around case studies drawing extensively from applications, and will yield a publicly-available final project or tutorial that will strengthen course participants' data science portfolios.

The course will primarily consist of sets of self-contained lectures and assignments that leverage real-world data science platforms when needed. As such, there is no assigned textbook, but there will be some recommended ones. Many lectures will come with links to required readings, which should be completed before or after the lecture (as declared), and, when appropriate, a list of links to other web resources.
### Prerequisites
Students enrolled in the course should be comfortable with programming (for those at UMD, having passed CMSC216 will be good enough!) and be reasonably mathematically mature. The course will heavily utilize the Python scripting language through Google Colab (or sometimes Jupyter Notebook if needed), relying on the Anaconda package manager. Primer lectures on Python for data science will be provided early on, so there's no need to worry if you haven't used Python before. Later lectures will delve into statistics and machine learning, potentially incorporating basic calculus and basic linear algebra. A light mathematical maturity, roughly at the level of a junior CS student, is preferred.

### Tentative Topics
Introduction to Data Science, Experiment Design, Introduction to Python, Data Types, Data collection, Git, Pandas, Database, SQL, Probability, Summary Statistics, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Data Exploration, Introduction to Machine Learning, Classifications, Decision Trees, Regression, Feature Engineering, ML Evaluation, Neural Network, Image Processing, Natural Language Processing (NLP) Introduction to Graph(s) Theory, Recommender Systems, Data Science Ethics

### Learning Outcomes
At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Develop a foundational understanding of data science, encompassing key concepts, methodologies, and tools.
* Proficiently use Python for data science applications, including data types, collection, and manipulation using libraries like Pandas.
* Explore machine learning concepts, including classifications, decision trees, regression, and feature engineering.
* Evaluate machine learning models using appropriate metrics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
* Understand advanced topics such as neural networks, image processing, natural language processing (NLP) etc.
* Understand the importance of applying ethical frameworks and guidelines to make informed decisions in real-world data scenarios.
* By the end of the course, students will have acquired a versatile skill set, enabling them to tackle real-world data science challenges with confidence and ethical awareness.
